# sqlgojson

Returns JSON from *sql.Rows

- postgresql only

## Installation

```
go get github.com/emirot/sqlgojson@v1.0.0
```


### Why this project

I wanted to get JSON return from the database whithout having a struct already defined.  
I found couple of examples online but no library.  
I took those ideas and added some tests and automations and make it a library.
